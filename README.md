# DECO Location Data Processing and Visualization

This repository contains scripts and files which process the location data associated with DECO events. We are able to extract detailed information from DECO users, including the time and GPS coordinates of uploaded events.

We display this information in engaging and interactive ways. Included so far are all-time and monthly leaderboards, displaying the countries most actively contributing to DECO. We are also finding interesting ways of overlaying data on interactive maps, using either Cartopy or the Google Maps API.
